##What's easier: Training a model or a cat?

We have recently adopted Oscar 🐈 (a cat) and I have tried to find a way to train him to keep off the toilet and kitchen counter.
I couldn't find an existing app or product doing it, so I built it myself 😎

✅ It is a very simple code.

✅ Versatile functionality- Easily adjustable, objects can be any item from the vast COCO classifier (listed in the git)

#Future features [road map]:

⬜ Add an easy to use API for a water sprinkler

⬜ Add sound alarm to deter the object

⬜ Create GUI

⬜ Convert to APK so it can be easily used on old android devices we all have at home.


I hope my cat will be impressed with how much I care for his education... 😉
